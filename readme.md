## Multimodal Image Captioning
Author: Rafa≈Ç Adamczyk

The goal of this project is to create a multimodal AI agent capable of providing a caption for presented image

Dataset used in project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr30k/data

It can be downloaded with:
```
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("adityajn105/flickr30k")
```

The image first goes through a CV model gathering the image features. 
The features are then passed to language model providing a caption. 
For feature extraction I will be using ResNet model (https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/)

I'm building my own vocabulary by tokenizing the captions file based on the frequency with nltk library. 
In tokenize.py I declare a class Tokenizer, which takes a file text as input and returns vocab dictionary.
